## Learn How to code C++

Learn how to code C++, a middle-level coding language. C++ can run on Linux, Mac and Windows  
The best specifications regarding reasons to learn C++ are:  

1. C++ dependance on hardware and memory. Due to being a C derived language, there are a lot of opportunities for users to interact with low-level language. This can inevitably lead to better software development and optimization of programs.
2. C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming  
3. With various ways to code, Object Orientation is one that C++ can soar with and you along with it. Learn the implementation of the 4 rules of OOP

## Mindstorms EV3 Autonomous Robot

**So what are we trying to do?:**
1. Our first goal in this project was to learn how to work as a team and accomplish the task of delegating our mission within the group
2. After this, we had people design the robot, work through a gantt chart and learn the MATLAB Documentation
3. Our first goal and milestone was getting the robot to work through remote control. This was not too difficult and was good for the team as we had to make small design changes as we learned how the [sensors](https://github.com/Markay12/mindstormsEV3#sensor-information) worked
4. From here, the group made many small design changes but ultimately led towards our final design of the robot which would be used for our autonomous control of the robot

**Our Goal**
* Successfully retrieve a handicapped figure through a maze and return to the start while avoiding walls and obeying traffic laws

**How Did we Achieve this Goal?**
* By working as a team and delegating our work together to ensure that the project was completed successfully and on time
